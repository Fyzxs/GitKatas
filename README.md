# Leaning Git Via Kata
This is a TDD/Pair Programming kata to learn to use git. It's the first of a few I expect to make. It's the basics, nothing fancy.

This kata is intended to be used in pair programming and TDD. That's how it's written. I recommend using FizzBuzz as the kata, but I don't think it is required.

### Objective
Experience Git while pair programming. There should be no merge issues. That's a future lesson.

### Basic Usage
This lession is focused on the basic push/pull mechanism of git. 
We have to use a small amount of git's branchin functionality, but not extensively.

#### The work
We will do "remote" Pair Programming, sitting right next to each other.
We will use Test-Ping-Pong. Instead of passing the keyboard and mouse back and forth, we will pass the source code back and forth.
Both participants need their computer. No need for shared monitors.
We will continue to sit next to each other for communication and conversation purposes without the need for headset/mic setups.

There's already a solution `GitPractice.sln` that can be opened once the project is pulled down.


## There are two available instructions.

[One for the Command Line, which is useful to know.](/GitCommandLine.md)

[Another for Visual Studio 2019.](GitVisualStudio.md)

Participants don't have to use the same instruction set. These can be alternated between as well, though there might be a little confusion in where you are if you try that.
